CSS Selectors:- CSS works?
In CSS Selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style.

Two main selectors:
.class    (eg. .intro)
                selects all the elememts with class ="intro"
#id      (eg. #firstname)
                selects the elememts with id ="firstname"   

call the class & ID :-
.class     Note :- class can be  called multiple times 
--> <div class ="myclass"> my class is called here </div>
<h3 class ="myclass"> myclass is called here </h3>

#id       Note :-id is called only once, as it is unique.
--> <div id ="myId"> myId is called here </div>
